Context variables are convenient when you need to pass a variable along the chain of calls so that they share the same context, in the case when this cannot be done through a global variable in case of concurrency. Context variables can be used as an alternative to global variables both in multi-threaded code and in asynchronous (with coroutines).

如果单独创建一个 `Context` 类的，会是个完全空的 context

```
init_ctx = Context()
```
